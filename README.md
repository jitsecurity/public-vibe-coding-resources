# Public Vibe Coding Resources

This repository provides a collection of resources, rules, and tools to enhance your coding workflow, project management, and AI-assisted development. It is designed to help teams and individuals standardize best practices, automate rule syncing, and leverage powerful Model Context Protocol (MCP) integrations.

## Repository Structure

### Recommended MCPs
- **Path:** `Recommended MCPs/`
- **Purpose:** Contains curated recommendations and documentation for Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools and services. The `recommended.md` file provides an overview of useful MCPs for browser integration, project management, documentation, and more.

### Sample Global Cursor Rule
- **Path:** `Sample global cursor rule/`
- **Purpose:** Provides a sample rule file (`rule.txt`) that defines best practices and deep research protocols for AI agents and developers. This rule emphasizes thorough research, detailed root cause analysis, comprehensive testing, and disciplined change management.

### Sample Project Rules
- **Path:** `Sample project rules/`
- **Purpose:** Contains example `.mdc` rule files for project-specific guidance. These include:
  - `tech_stack.mdc`: Documents the technical stack and environment separation.
  - `full-feature-tracking.mdc`: Outlines the responsibilities and operating principles for AI assistants in development workflows, including coding, debugging, and project management.
  - `devin-rule.mdc`: Provides instructions for using a scratchpad and lessons log to improve task management and learning from past mistakes.
  - `coding_preferences.mdc`: Lists coding and workflow preferences to ensure code quality, maintainability, and adherence to team standards.

### VSCode MDC Rules Sync
- **Path:** `vscode-mdc-rules-sync/`
- **Purpose:** A VSCode extension for syncing MDC rule files from a GitHub repository to your local `.cursor/rules` folder. Features include:
  - Listing and selecting MDC files from a remote repository
  - GitHub authentication and token management
  - File diffing and merge options
  - Automated and manual rule syncing
  - See the folder's own `README.md` for full usage and development instructions

## Getting Started
- Browse the `Recommended MCPs/recommended.md` for tools to enhance your workflow.
- Use the sample rules as templates for your own projects or teams.
- Install and configure the VSCode extension to keep your rules up to date.
